    <p>Table tennis is also known as ping-pong. This game was invented in England in early days of 20 <sup>th</sup> century.
      Professional table tennis is played on a hard table which is divided by a net. Players stand opposite to each other,
      and hit a lightweight ball with a small round bat across the table.
       Spinning the ball makes the chances of hitting the ball a lot less. So, players tend to spin the ball before serving it to the opponent.
    Table tennis is played as singles as well as doubles. It is played in both men’s and women’s category.
     Table tennis is played by the rules set by the International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF).</p>
